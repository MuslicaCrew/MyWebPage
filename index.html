    and with gameplay that makes you never stand up and leave the game!<br>
      The dialogues are filled with inappropriate jokes.
      If you're humor is stuck at a child's level you are in for a treat!<br>

    The series has received critical acclaim and commercial success for its loot-driven multiplayer co-op gameplay and its sense of humor.<br>
    As of August 2019, more than 45 million copies of Borderlands games had been shipped, with 22 million from Borderlands 2.
    An additional 5 million copies of Borderlands 3 were sold within five days of release, bringing the total series' net revenues to over US$1 billion.
    This makes it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time.<br>
    A film adaptation of the series is in development by Lionsgate.<br>
    A reason for its success could be the cartoon-like look. Although the game looks like a comic book the scenery is so pretty. Check out the pcitures in the media tab!

    I like this game because the jokes they make are so corny and childish.<br> 
    I love the gameplay. It may not be challenging and it gets repetitive after a long time of farming for the best gun, but it is still brilliant in my eyes.<br>
    The prequel (pre-prequel) of this game is Borderlands 2. That game is like BL3 but without the quality of life changes (mantling) and with worse graphics.<br> 
    If killin' psychos is your thing you should buy the game.<br> 
    It is quiet frequently on sale so you don't even have to pay the full price for a game that gives you hundreds of hours of fun!
